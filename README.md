Introspecting different Commercial Movie Recommendation Platforms

• Designed web crawlers for Amazon Prime and Netflix to gather movie recommendation outputs produced by recommendation systems of these two websites.
• Worked on finding promotional bias in recommendations by these websites by analysing network-centric patterns across the recommendation networks formed by the outputs from movie recommendation websites.
• Used Pagerank centrality algorithm, bow-tie analysis etc. to analyse the network and compared with IMDb ratings and views list to look out for promotional bias.
